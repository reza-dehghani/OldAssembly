# OldAssembly

Assembly seems that deprecated and so old but because of its importance in hardware understanding taught in many universities.  :roll_eyes:	

This repository simple programs that I wrote with emu 8086 and funny big problem assembly language :nerd_face: , such as sorting, add/sub/mul/divide 32 bit numbers, calculate math problem(a^n/ n!) and ... . every program specify with it's name and all tested.
